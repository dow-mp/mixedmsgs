## Project Overview
For this project, we built a "hype up" message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output meant to inspire confidence and good feelings for their day. 

Prerequisites:
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## Process
- Planning completed using a private Discord server
- Idea/language to be used developed by Dow-mp
- HTML/CSS written by sharkba1t
- JSON fetching via Javascript developed by jlema
- Javascript for animation, randomization, and interactivity developed collaboratively by sharkba1t, Dow-mp, jlema

## Built using

- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- JSON
- Node.JS
- Command line
- Git and GitHub

## What we learned
Working collaboratively on a project using Git and Github was novel to the team. We were able to learn how to effectively complete pull requests, merge branches, and fetch information from the remote repository. The team worked well together providing valuable suggestions as branches were developed.
